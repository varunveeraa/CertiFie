## ðŸ’¡ **Technical Architecture**

### Issuance Workflow:
1. **Document Upload**: The certificate is uploaded and stored on a decentralized storage network (IPFS).
2. **Hash Generation**: A unique hash of the document is created for integrity verification.
3. **Blockchain Storage**: The document hash and IPFS pointer are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: The hash ensures that duplicate certificates cannot be issued.

### Verification Workflow:
1. **Hash Verification**: The uploaded certificate or provided hash is checked against the blockchain.
2. **Status Check**: The blockchain confirms whether the certificate is valid, revoked, or invalid.
3. **Certificate Retrieval**: The document is retrieved from IPFS for review, download, or sharing.
